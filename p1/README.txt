Assignment 1: BFS, DFS, GBFS on navigation

The program was tested on the server unix.cs.tamu.edu with Python version 2.6.9 

Command to compile the program:

python test.py graphfile x1 y1 x2 y2 searchFunction

For example:

To run the program to find the path from (1,1) to (4,4) by using the
search function BFS (Breadth-First Search) with the file ATM.graph.txt,
use the following command:

python test.py ATM.graph.txt 1 1 4 4 b

In order to run the program by using another search function, refer to the 
list below:

b = for BFS
d = for DFS
g = for GBFS
